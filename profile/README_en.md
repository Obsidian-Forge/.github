# Community Background

We are Obsidian users from China. Since most Obsidian plugins are written in English, non-English speakers often face difficulties using them smoothly. To address this, we developed the Obsidian-i18n plugin to translate other Obsidian plugins. With the efforts of dozens of Chinese volunteers, we have completed translations for over 300 plugins. Here is the [list of translated plugins](https://vika.cn/share/shrULbfcRrjrXZVfMA9P4/dstYkrs9t44YXVqf1r/viwriSAj9INh6).


The Obsidian-i18n plugin works by replacing strings in other plugins to achieve translation, a method that is not widely endorsed. As a result, our plugin has not been approved for listing on the official plugin marketplace. We respect the wishes of the Obsidian official team and other plugin developers but still believe that relying solely on PRs (Pull Requests) for translations makes internationalization challenging to advance. Therefore, we aim to demonstrate through action that while our method may not be elegant, it is effective.


Our plan is to use this approach initially to quickly accumulate and iterate on translations. Once these translations mature, we intend to submit them back to to original plugin projects via PR collaboration.


Since all translations come from the collective efforts of many community members, we established Obsidian-Forge as a non-profit organization dedicated to contributing localization efforts under its name for other plugins' benefit; however due mainly because our current influence within communities remains limited primarily among those who speak Simplified Chinese only at present time hence why currently only providing Simplified-Chinese language support right now too!


If you're an Obsidian Plugin Developer interested adding your own project's simplified-chinese version please feel free contact us anytime -we'd love help out with translating yours!
